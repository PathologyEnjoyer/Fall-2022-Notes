\section*{Lecture 1}

\defn

A \underline{metric space} is a set $X$ equipped with a function $d:X\times X \to \R$, which satisfies the following axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For any $x, y \in X$, $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
	\item For any $x, y, z \in X$, we have $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$. This is called the ``triangle inequality"
	\item For any $x, y \in X$, $d(x, y) = 0$ exactly when $x = y$

\end{enumerate}

\exm

For $x, y \in \R^n$, 
\[
d(x, y) := \left(\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - y_i)^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

This is called the Euclidean distance. 2 can be replaced with any real $r \geq 1$, and it will still be a metric. 

\exm 

In this example, $C[0, 1]$ is the set of all continuous functions $f:[0, 1]\to\R$. Here, 
\[
d(f, g) := \sup_{x\in[0,1]}|f(x)- g(x)|
\]

\exm

Let $X = \N$, the natural numbers, including $0$. Let $p$ be a fixed prime number. The $p$-adic metric on $\N$ is defined by 
\[
d_p(a, b) := \frac{1}{p^\alpha} 
\]
Where $p^\alpha$ is the largest power of $p$ which divides $|a - b|$. So two naturals are ``close" if their difference is divisible by a high power of $p$. 

\claim This is a metric

\proof
The 1st and 3rd axioms are clear. So we must prove the triangle inequality. We will consider the three quantities $d_p(a, b), d_p(a, t)$, and $d_p(b, t)$, where $a, b, t \in \N$. 

Suppose $p^\beta$ divides both $a - t$ and $t - b$. Then $p^\beta$ divides $(a - t) + (t - b) = a - b$. Therefore, 
\[
d_p(a, b) \leq \frac{1}{p^\beta} \leq \max(d_p(a, t), d_p(t, b)) \leq d_p(a, t) + d_p(t, b)
\]
\qed

\defn

Let $(X, d_X), (Y, d_Y)$ be two metric spaces. For a function $f:X\to Y$, we say that $f$ is \underline{continuous} at $x_0 \in X$ if, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $\delta > 0$ such that 
\[
0 < |d_X(x_0, x)| < \delta \implies |d_Y(f(x_0), f(x))| < \epsilon
\]

A function $f:X\to Y$ is said to be continuous if it is continuous at $x$ for all $x \in X$. 

\exm

Consider a map $(\N, d_5) \to (\N, d_5)$ defined by 
\[
x\mapsto x^2
\]

Is this continuous? 

At 0, to be continuous, then for any $x$, if we want to get within a small distance of 0, then $x$ has to be divisible by large powers of $5$. 

What about at $11$?

This is continuous. 

\exm

What about $(\N,d_5) \to (\N, d_{17})$. 

\section*{Lecture 2}

\thm

If $f:(X, d_X)\to (Y, d_Y)$ and $g:(Y, d_Y)\to(Z, d_Z)$ are both continuous, then $g \circ f:(X, d_X)\to(Z, d_Z)$

\proof

Fix $x \in X$ and $\varepsilon>0$. Choose $\delta_1 > 0$ so that if $d_Y(f(x), y) < \delta_1$, then $d_Z(gf(x), g(y)) < \varepsilon$. 

By continuity of $f$, we may then choose a $\delta_0 > 0$ such that if $d_X(x, x') < \delta_2$, then $d_Y(f(x), f(x')) < \delta_1$. 

\qed

\defn For a metric space $(X, d_X)$, and a real $r > 0$, the open $r$-ball around a point $x$ is defined as
\[
B_r(x) = \{x' \in X \mid d(x, x') < r\}
\]

Exercise: State and prove some theorem about the existence of a function from $X \times X' \to Y \times Y'$, given a function $f:X\to Y$ and $g:X'\to Y'$. 

\exm{Balls}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In $\R^2$, consider 
\[
d_r\left(\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} x_2 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix} \right) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^2 (x_i - y_i)^r\right)^{\frac{1}{r}}
\]

For $r = 2$, this is the usual euclidean distance. For $r = 1$, the balls look like diamonds. In the limit, as $r\to \infty$, the metric will approach what is known as the ``box metric," in which the distance between any point and 0 is it's largest coordinate. 
\item On $C[0, 1]$, the set of continuous functions from $[0, 1]$ to $\R$, we have the sup metric: 
\[
d(f, g) = \sup_{x\in[0, 1]}|f(x) - g(x)|
\]

\item We also have
\[
d_1(f, g) = \int_0^1d|f(x) - g(x)|dx
\]



\end{enumerate}

\defn

For a metric space $(X, d_X)$, suppose that $U \subseteq X$ is said to be ``open" if, for any $x \in U$, there is a $\varepsilon>0$ such that $B_\varepsilon(x) \subseteq U$. 

\lem 

$B_\varepsilon(x)$ is always open. 

\proof

Let $y \in B_\varepsilon(x)$. Let $t = d(x, y)$. By construction, $t <\varepsilon$. Let $\delta = \varepsilon - t$. Consider $B_\delta(y)$. For any $z \in B_\delta(y)$, we have by the triangle inequality
\[
d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) < \varepsilon - t + t = \varepsilon
\]
and so $z \in B_\varepsilon(x)$. $z$ was arbitrary, so we are done.

\qed

\section*{Lecture 3}

\defn Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. A set $U\subseteq X$ is said to be \underline{open} if for all $x \in U$, there is an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B(x, \varepsilon) \subseteq U$. 

\thm Let $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ be a collection of open sets. Then

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\cup_{\alpha\in A}U_\alpha$ is open. 
\item Let $U_1, \dots, U_n$ be a finite subcollection. Then $\cap_{i=1}^\oo U_i$ is open. 
\end{enumerate}

\proof




\section*{Lecture 4}

\defn 

Two metrics $d_1, d_2$ are said to be \underline{equivalent} on a space $X$ if any set which is open under the $d_1$-induced topology is also open under the $d_2$-induced topology, and vice versa. 

\exm 

In $\R^2$, 
\begin{align*}
d_2(0, (x, y)) & = (x^2 + y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
d_1(0, (x, y)) & = |x| + |y| \\
d_{\infty}(0, (x, y)) & = \max\{|x|, |y|\} \\
\end{align*}

How do these metric's unit balls compare? In fact, $d_1$'s is within $d_2$'s, which is within $d_{\oo}$'s.

But all of these balls contain a ball of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ in any of the three metric. Thus, these are equivalent. 

\defn

Two metrics $d_1, d_2$ are called \underline{Lipschitz equivalent} if there exists some $k \in \R$ such that, for all $x, y \in X$, we have

\[
\frac{1}{k}d_2(x, y) 
< d_1(x, y) < kd_2(x, y)
\]

\exm

This is a non-example. The 5-adic and the 17-adics are not equivalent. 

\exm

Let 
\begin{align*}
d_1(f, g) & = \int_0^1|f(x) - g(x)|\,dx \\
d_\oo(f, g) & = \sup_{x\in[0, 1]}|f(x) - g(x)| \\
\end{align*}

One controls for area, one controls for the maximum value of $f$. We have
\[
B^{d_\oo}_\varepsilon (0) \subset B^{d_1}_\varepsilon(0)
\] 
This is because if we control for the maximum size of $f$, we can surely control for the area under it. However, no matter how much we limit the area under $f$, there is some $f$ which has that much area which has a sup greater than some $\varepsilon$ which is fixed. 

\thm

Let $d_1, d_2$ be equivalent metrics on $X$. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f:X\to Y$ is $d_1, d_Y$ continuous if and only if it is $d_2, d_Y$ continuous. 
\item $g:Z\to X$ is $d_Z, d_1$ continuous if and only if if is $d_Z, d_2$ continuous. 
\end{enumerate}

\proof

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $U \subset Y$ be open. We know that the preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ is open under the $d_1$ metric. But by the equivalence of $d_1, d_2$, $f^{-1}(U)$ must also be open under the $d_2$ metric. The reverse argument also holds. 
\item Let $U \subset X$ be an open set under the $d_1$ metric. By continuity of $g$, we know $g^{-1}(U)$ is open. However, $U$ must also be open under the $d_2$ metric, meaning that $g$ must be continuous with respect to both metrics. 
\end{enumerate}

\qed

Recall: If $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ is a collection of open sets, then $\cup_{\alpha\in A}U_\alpha$ is open. 

We can associate to any set $R\subset X$ an open set, called the interior of $R$. 

\defn

For any $\R\subset X$, we define it's \underline{interior} by 
\[
\operatorname{int}(R) = \bigcup_{U\text{ open}, U \subseteq R}U
\]

We can say several things about $\operatorname{int}(R)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\operatorname{int}(R)$ is open. 
\item If $U$ is open, then $\operatorname{int}(U) = U$, and vice versa. 
\item Suppose $A \subseteq B$. Then $\operatorname{int}(A) \subseteq \intr(B)$. 
\end{enumerate}

Recall: If $\{C_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ are all closed, then $\cap_{\alpha\in A}C_\alpha$ is closed. 

\defn 

If $R\subseteq X$, then the \underline{closure} of $R$, denoted by $\bar{R}$, or sometimes $\cl(R)$, is defined as 
\[
\bar{R}:= \bigcap_{C\text{ closed}, C\supseteq R}C
\]

Analagously, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\bar{R}$ is closed for any $R$. 
\item $R$ is closed if and only if $R = \bar{R}$. 
\item If $A \subset B$, then $\cl(A) \subset \cl(B)$. 
\end{enumerate}

\prop

Let $x \in \cl(R)$. Then, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $B_\varepsilon(x)\cap R \neq \varnothing$, and vice-versa. 

We will prove this next lecture. 

\section*{Lecture 4}

\proof 

First, suppose that $x\not\in \bar{A}$. The complement of $\bar{A}$ is open, so there exists a $\varepsilon>0$ such that $B_{\varepsilon}(x)\subseteq (\bar{A})^c$, and so $B_{\varepsilon}(x) \cap \bar{A} = \varnothing$. 

Now, suppose that there exists some $\varepsilon> 0$ such that $B_{\varepsilon}(x) \cap A = \varnothing$. Then $(B_{\varepsilon}(x))^c$ is a closed set containing $A$ which does not contain $x$, thus $\bar{A}$ cannot contain $x$. 

\qed

Now, it is time for the main event. 

\subsection*{\underline{Topological Spaces}}

Let $X$ be a set. Let $\ms{P}(X)$ denote the power set of $X$, which is the set of all subsets of $X$. 

\defn

Let $\ms{T} \subset\ms{P}(X)$. $\ms{T}$ is a \underline{topology on $X$} if it has the following properties: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\varnothing, X \in \ms{T}$. 
\item If $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in A}$ with each $U_\alpha \in \ms{T}$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}U_\alpha \in \ms{T}$. 
\item If $A, B \in \ms{T}$, then $A \cap B \in \ms{T}$. Of course, we can ``strengthen" this to the equivalent statement: if $U_1, \dots, U_k \in \ms{T}$, then $\cap_{i=1}^kU_i \in \ms{T}$
\end{enumerate}

Elements of $\ms{T}$ are called ``open sets." 

\exm Here are some simple examples. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Open sets in $(X, d)$ form a topology (hence the definition)
\item $\ms{T} = \ms{P}(X)$ forms the discrete topology. 
\item $\ms{T} = \{\varnothing, X\}$ forms the indescrete topolgy.
\item If $X = \{0, 1\}$, then $\ms{T} = \{\varnothing, X, \{0\}\}$ forms a topology. 
\item We can form the \underline{Zariski topology} on $\R$ by specifying the closed sets, which satisfy a similar but slightly different set of axioms. We define the closed sets to be $\varnothing, \R$, and any finite collection of points. 

More generally, the Zariski topology on some ring $R$ is specified by its closed sets, which are the solution locii of some set of polynomials in $R$. 
\item Let $X = \R$, $\ms{T} = \{(r, \oo)\mid r\in\R\} \cup \{\varnothing, \R\}$. 
\end{enumerate}

We have now defined a set of objects (topological spaces). Now, we want to define morphisms, the maps between spaces. 

\defn Let $(X, \ms{T}_X), (Y, \ms{T}_Y)$ be topological spaces. We say a function $f:X\to Y$ is \underline{continuous} if, for all $V\in\ms{T}_Y$, $f^{-1}(V) \in \ms{T}_X$. In other words, the preimage of any open subset of $Y$ is an open subset of $X$. 

\exm

\begin{enumerate} Some baby examples
\item Any function $f:(X, \text{discrete})\to (Y, \ms{T}_Y)$ is continuous as long as $X$ has the discrete metric, as the preimage of any open set will be a subset of $X$, all of which are open under the discrete topology. 
\item Any function $f:(X,\ms{T}_X)\to(Y,\text{ discrete})$ is continous for a similar reason. 
\item $\Id_X:(X, \ms{T}_X)\to(X,\ms{T}_X)$ is continuous. 
\end{enumerate}

\thm 

Let $f:(X,\ms{T}_X)\to(Y,\ms{T}_Y)$ and $g:(Y,\ms{T}_Y)\to(Z,\ms{T}_Z)$ be continuous functions. Then $g \circ f:(X,\ms{T}_X)\to(Z,\ms{T}_Z)$ is continuous. 

In other words, the composition of continuous functions is continuous. 

\proof

Pick $W \in \ms{T}_Z$. Then $g^{-1}(W) \in \ms{T}_Y$ since $g$ is continuous. So, because $f$ is continuous, 
\[
(g\circ f)^{-1}(W) = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(W)) \in\ms{T}_X
\]
Hence, $g \circ f$ is continuous. 

\defn 

For $\ms{T}$ a topology on $X$, a \underline{basis} for $\ms{T}$ is a subset $\ms{B}\subseteq\ms{T}$ such that every set in $\ms{T}$ is the union of sets in $\ms{B}$. 

\section*{Lecture 5}

\prop

Suppose $f:(X, \ms{T}_X) \to (Y, \ms{T}_Y)$ is a function. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(B) \in \ms{T}_X$ for all $B \in \ms{B}$, with $\ms{B}$ a basis for $\ms{T}_Y$.

\proof

The forward direction is trivial, as a basis consists of sets which are all open. 

Now, suppose that $f^{-1}(B) \in \ms{T}_X$ for all $B \in \ms{B}$. Let $V\in \ms{T}_Y$. Write it as $\cup_{\alpha\in A}B_\alpha = V$ for $B_{\alpha}\in \ms{B}$. 

Then $f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(\cup_{\alpha\in A}B_\alpha) = \cup_{\alpha\in A}f^{-1}(B_\alpha)$. This is the union of open subsets of $X$, so $f^{-1}(V)$ is open. 

\qed

\exm

Consider $B_{\frac{p}{q}}(\frac{r}{s})$, with $p, q, r, s \in \Z$, $q, s \neq 0$. In other words, the balls of rational radius and rational center. This collection of sets forms a basis for $\R$ using the standard (or, as Darren calls it, the ``Mother's Knee") topology. 

Exercise: Write down the definition of interiors and closures, and check the following lemma is true: 

\lem 

$x \in \cl(A)$ if and only if, for all open $U \ni x$, $U\cap A \neq \varnothing$. 

\exm

Consider $(\N,$ Zariski). What is the closure of the collection of prime numbers under this topology? 

Recall that the Zariski topology on $\N$ defines closed sets to be either empty, $\N$, or finite. So, for example, the closure of the integers from $1$ to $10$ is itself. 

But the only closed set that can contain an infinite set is $\N$, so the closure of the primes is $\N$. More generally, for any infinite subset of $\N$, the closure is $\N$. 

\subsection*{\underline{Subobjects and product objects}}

We have now defined our objects and morphisms, so let's talk about subobjects and product objects. 

Let $(X, \ms{T}_X)$ be a topological space, and $A\subseteq X$ a nonempty subset. 

Denote the inclusion map $\iota:A\to X$. We want to topologize $A$ so that $\iota$ is continuous, and is as small as possible, in the sense that any topology for which $\iota$ is continuous includes this topology on $A$. 

For any open $U\subseteq X$, we want $\iota^{-1}(U)$ to be open. But $\iota^{-1}(U) = U \cap A$. 

\defn

For $(X, \ms{T}_X)$ a topological space and $A\subset X$ a subset, then the \underline{subspace topology} on $A$, $\ms{T}_A$, consists of 
\[
\ms{T}_A := \{U \cap A \mid U \in \ms{T}_X\}
\]

\prop

Suppose we have a commutative diagram of the form 
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
(Z, \ms{T}_Z) \arrow[rd, "\iota \circ g"'] \arrow[r, "g"] & A \arrow[d, "\iota"] \\
& X \\
\end{tikzcd}
\]

Then $\iota$ is continuous if and only if $\iota \circ g$ is continuous. 

\proof

One direction is trivial, as we know the composition of continuous functions is continuous. Now, suppose that $\iota \circ g$ is continuous. 

Let $W \in \ms{T}_A$. We know $W = W^*\cap A$ for some $W^* \in \ms{T}_X$. $\iota \circ g$ is continuous, so $(\iota \circ g)^{-1}W^*\in\ms{T}_Z$. 

So, $\ms{T}_Z\ni(\iota\circ g)^{-1} = g^{-1}(\iota^{-1}(W^*)) = g^{-1}(W)$. 

\qed

So we can see that if we want the above to hold, we are forced into our definition of $\ms{T}_A$. 

\prop

$\ms{T}_A$ is the only topology so that the previous proposition is true for all spaces $(Z, \ms{T}_Z)$ and functions $g$. 

\proof

Suppose that $\ms{T}_{\mu}$ ($\mu$ for ``mystery" topology) such that the previous proposition holds for all choices of $(Z, \ms{T}_Z)$ and $g:(Z,\ms{T}_Z)\to A$.  

Consider 
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
(A,\ms{T}_A)\arrow[rd, "\iota \circ \Id"'] \arrow[r, "\Id"] & (A, \ms{T}_\mu) \arrow[d, "\iota"] \\
& (X, \ms{T}_X \\
\end{tikzcd}
\]
