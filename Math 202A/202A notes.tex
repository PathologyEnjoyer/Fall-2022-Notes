\section*{Lecture 1}

We begin by trying to gain a deeper understanding of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 

Let $f:X\to \C$, where $X \subset \C^n$. For now, let's say $X \subset \C$. In real analysis, we have a notion of differentiability for $f:\R^n\to\R^k$. We can say that $f$ is differentiable at a point $p \in X$ when
\[
f(p + h) = f(p) + (df_p)h + \rho(h)
\]
Where $(df)_p:\R^n\to\R^k$ is a linear map $\in \Hom_{\R}(\R^n,\R^k)$, and $\frac{|\rho(h)|}{|h|} \to 0$ as $h \to 0$. 

So we can think of the ``real differential" as a linear map in $\Hom_{\R}(\C^n,\C)$. 

\defn

Let $X \subset \C$, and $f:X\to\C$. Differentiability refers to the existence of a $(df)_p \in \Hom_{\R}(\C,\C)$. 

So, $f$ is complex differentiable at $p \in X$ means that 
\[
f(p + h) = f(p) + f'(p)h + \rho(h)
\]
Where $f'(p)$ is a complex number and $\frac{|\rho(h)|}{|h|}\to 0$. 

If $A \in \Hom_{\C})(\C,\C) \cong \C$, $A(z) = \alpha z, \alpha \in \C$. 

So $(df)_p \in \Hom_{\C}(\C,\C)$.

$\Hom_{\C}(\C,\C)$ is a $\C$-vector space of dimension 1. 

$\Hom_{\R}(\C, \C) \cong \Hom_{\R}(\R^2,\R^2)$ is a $\C$-vector space of dimension 2. 

So where did the extra dimension go? What happened? 

Consider an element of $\Hom_{\R}(\C,\C)$ given by $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \mapsto x - iy$. 

We also have $\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \mapsto x + iy$. 

From the real analysis point of view, these two functions are equal to their differentials. The first is called $d\bar{z}$, and the second is called $dz$.

$dz = dx + idy$ and
$d\bar{z} = dx - idy$
\begin{align*}
dx\begin{pmatrix} h_1 \\ h_2 \end{pmatrix} & = h_1 \\
dy\begin{pmatrix} h_1 \\ h_2 \end{pmatrix} & = h_2 \\
\end{align*}

On a complex vector space, suppose $\phi\in\Hom_{\mathbb{K}}(\C^n,\C)$, we have $(\bar{\phi})(v) = \bar{\phi(v)}.$ So $\bar{dz} = d\bar{z}$. 

Now, $\C$-valued real differentiable functions are just pairs of $\R$-valued real differentiable functions. 

\exm

If $k, m \in \N$, then $z^k\bar{z}^m:\C\to\C$ is a \underline{real} smooth function (when viewed as an element of $\Hom_{\R}(\R^2, \R^2)$), with

\[
d(z^k\bar{z}^m) = kz^{k - 1}\bar{z}^m + m\bar{z}^{m - 1}z^kd\bar{z}
\]

We will study the differences between $\Hom_{\R}(\C^n, \C)$ versus $\Hom_{\C}(\C^n, \C)$, with complex dimensions $2$ and $1$, respectively. 

\defn Let $V$ be a real vector space. 

A \underline{complex structure} on $V$ is a $J \in \End_{\R}(V)$ which satisfies $J^2 = -\operatorname{Id}_V$

\prop Define $V_J = V$ as a set and group, with a $\C$-action $\C\times V_J \to V_J$ defined by $((\alpha + i\beta), x) \mapsto \alpha x + \beta Jx.$

\proof Check $z(wx) = (zw)x$ for all $z, w \in \C$ and $x \in V_J$. 

\prop If a vector space $V$ admits a complex structure $J$, then $\dim_\R V = 2n$. Further, $\dim_\R V = 2\dim_\C V_J$. 

\proof 

First, $\det(J^2) = \det(-id_V) = (-1)^{\dim_\R V}$, so the dimension must be even. Alternatively, if $e_1, \dots, e_n$ is a basis of $V_J$, then check $e_1, \dots, e_n, Je_1, \dots, Je_n$ is a basis of $V$ over $R$.

\exm For $\R^2$, let $J_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & - 1\\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}$. We see that $J_0\begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -y \\ x \end{pmatrix}$.  This is like $i(x + iy) = ix - y$.

So $A: (\R^2)_{J_0} \to \C$ is an isomorphism of $\C$-vector spaces. 

Let $W$ be a vector space over $\C$. Consider $W_{\R}$, a real vector space. We see $\dim_{\R}W_{\R} = 2\dim_{\C}W$. Consider $J:W_\R\to W\R$ given by $x \mapsto ix$. Then $J^2 = -\Id_{W_\R}$. 

Let $V$ be a real vector space with complex structure $J$. Consider $\Hom_{\R}(V, \C) =\C\otimes_{\R} V^*$. 

$J^t: \Hom_{\R}(V, \C)\to\Hom_{\R}(V, \C)$, we can express $\Hom_{\R}(V,\C) \ni \phi = \phi_1 + \phi_2$, and by definition, 
\[
J^t \phi = \phi \circ J = \phi_1 \circ J + i\phi_2 \circ J
\]
So $(J^t)^2 = -1$. 

$J^t \in \End_{\C}(\Hom_{\R}(V, \C))$. 

Main observation: $\phi \in \Hom_\R(V, \C)$ is $\C$-linear in $V_j$, meaning $\phi(ix) = i\phi(x)$, which is equivalent to $\phi(Jx) = i\phi(x)$. 

In other words, such a $\phi$ is only $\C$-linear if $\phi$ is an eigenfunction of $J^t$ with eigenvalue $i$. 

\defn $\phi$ is $\C$-antilinear on $V_J$ means 
\[
\phi((\alpha + i\beta)x) = \bar{(\alpha + i\beta)}\phi(x)
\]
for all $x \in V$. 

We denote the space of $\C$-antilinear functionals by $\bar{\Hom}_{\C}(V_J,\C)$. 

In fact, there is an isomorphism between $\Hom_{\C}(V_J,\C)$ and $\bar{\Hom}_{\C}(V_J, \C)$ as \underline{real} vector spaces. 

\thm 

Let $V$ be a real vector space with complex structure $J$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Hom_{\R}(V, \C) = \Hom_{\C}(V_J, \C)\oplus\bar{\Hom}_{\C}(V_J, \C)$. 
\item If $\Hom_{\C}(V_J, \C) := V^{1, 0}$, and $\bar{\Hom}_{\C}(V_J, \C) := V^{0, 1}$, then $\Hom_{\R}(V,\C) = V^{1, 0} \oplus_{\C}V^{0, 1}$. 
\item $\dim_{\C}V^{1, 0} = \dim_{\C}V^{0, 1} = \frac{\dim_{\C}(\Hom_{\R}(V, \C))}{2}$
\end{enumerate}

\proof

Observe that $\phi \in \Hom_{\R}(V, \C)$ can be written as 
\[
\phi = \frac{\phi -i\phi\circ J}{2} + \frac{\phi + i\phi\circ J}{2} = \frac{\phi(Jx) + i\phi(x)}{2} = i\frac{\phi - i\phi\circ J}{2}(x) = \phi
\]

Further, $V^{1, 0} \cap V^{0, 1} = 0$ by the definitions, so we are done. 

\qed

Thus, any differential can be split into a $\C$-linear and a $\C$-antilinear part. 

\defn

$\pi^{1, 0}$ is projection on the first factor, $\pi^{0, 1}$ is projection onto the second. We have
\[
\phi = \pi^{1, 0}\phi + \pi^{0, 1}\phi
\]

\cor

If $\phi \in \Hom_{\R}(V,\C)$, then $\phi$ being $\C$-linear (i.e $\phi \in V^{1, 0}$) if and only if $\pi^{0, 1}\phi = 0$. 

\defn

Applying to $(df)_p \in \Hom_{\R}(V, \C)$, then 
\[
(df)_p = \pi^{1, 0}df_p + \pi^{0, 1}df_p
\]
Say $\pi^{1, 0}df_p = \underbrace{\partial f_p}_{\text{ complex linear}}$ and $\pi^{0, 1}df_p = \underbrace{\bar{\partial}df_p}_{\text{ complex antilinear}}$

\thm A function $f:X\to\C$ is $\C$-differentiable at $p \in X$ if and only if $f$ is $\R$-differentiable at $p$ and $df_p = \partial f_p$, which happens if and only if $\bar{\partial}f_p = 0$. 

\proof

We have $\C \cong \R^2_{J_0}$, which has standard basis $\R^2 = \langle e_1, e_2\rangle_{\R^2}$. This has a dual basis in $\Hom_{\R}(\R^2, \R)$ given by $dx$ and $dy$. That is, $\Hom_{\R}(\R^2, \C) = \langle dx, dy \rangle_{\C}$. 

$J_0e_1 = e_2$ and $J_0e_2 = -e_1$, so $dx \circ J_0 = -dy$ and $dy \circ J_0 = dx$. 

\begin{align*}
\pi^{0, 1}dx & =\frac{1}{2}(dx - idx\circ J_0)\\
				 & = \frac{1}{2}(dx + idy) & := dz \\
\end{align*}

Further, 
\begin{align*}
\pi^{0, 1}dx & = \frac{1}{2}d\bar{z} \\
\pi^{1, 0}dy & = \frac{1}{2}dz \\
\end{align*}

So 
\[
df = f_xdx + f_ydy = \frac{f_x - if_y}{2}dz + \frac{f_x + if_y}d\bar{z} = \partial f + \bar{\partial} f
\]

\defn

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} & = \frac{\partial_x - i\partial_y}{2} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}} & = \frac{\partial_x + i\partial_y}{2} \\
\end{align*}

So 

\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz + \frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}}d\bar{z}
\]

So analyticity is equivalent to $df = \partial f$, meaning $\bar{\partial}f = 0$, which is equivalent to $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \bar{z}} = 0$, which means
\[
\frac{\partial (u + iv)}{\partial\bar{z}} = 0
\]
So $(\partial_x + i\partial_y)(u + iv) = 0$. Multiplying out, we get
\begin{align*}
u_x & = v_y \\
u_y = - v_x \\
\end{align*}

\section*{Lecture 2} 

The focus for the first bit of this course will be the so-called (by Dennis) $\bar{\del}$-calculus. 

Suppose $f:X\to\C$ is differentiable for some $X \subseteq \R^{2n}$. It has a differential $df_p \in \Hom_\R(\R^{2n},\C)$.

$f$ is holomorphic if and only if $df_p\in\Hom_{\C}(\C^n, \C)$. Last time, we talked about how the second sits in the first, and how they interact. 

Question: How to make $\C^n$ out of $\R^{2n}$. The abstract algebra way to do it is with a complex structure $J$. If $V$ is a vector space over $\R$, then $\dim_\R V = 2n$
$J\in\End_{\R}(V)$ with $J^2 = -\Id_V$. 

For all $x \in V_J$, we define $ix = Jx$, so $V_J$ is a vector space over $\C$, and $\dim_\C V_j = \frac{\dim_\R V}{2}$

\exm Let $V = \R^2$, $J = J_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}$. $\R^2_{J_0}\cong \C$

Last time, we showed that for any $\phi\in\Hom_\R(V,\C) = H$, then 
\[
\phi = \underbrace{\frac{\phi - i\phi\circ J}{2}}_{\in \Hom_\C(V_J,\C)} + \underbrace{\frac{\phi + i\phi\circ J}{2}}_{\in\bar{\Hom_\C}(V_J,\C)}
\]

So, $H = \Hom_\C(V_J,\C)\oplus\bar{\Hom_\C(V_J,\C)} = V^{1, 0}\oplus V^{0, 1}$

Where $V^{1, 0}$ and $V^{0, 1}$ are what we call $\Hom_\C(V_J,\C)$ and $\bar{\Hom}_\C(V_J,\C)$ by tradition. 

Let $V = \R^2$, $J = J_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}$. 

Let $\phi = df_p = \frac{\del f(p)}{\del x}dx_p + \frac{\del f(p)}{\del y}dy_p$

After doing some computations, we get

\[
d_pf = \pi^{1, 0}df + \pi^{0, 1}df = Adz + Bd\bar{z}
\]

Where $dz = dx + idy$ and $d\bar{z} = dx - idy$. You can check that the former is in $V^{1, 0}$ and the latter in $V^{0, 1}$. 

The coefficient $A$ is denoted by tradition as $\frac{\del f}{\del z}(p)$, and $B$ as $\frac{\del f}{\del \bar{z}}(p)$. Here, the presence of $\del$ does not imply any limit taking or anything, they are just notation. 

Note $A = \frac{1}{2}(\del_xf - i\del_yf)|_p$ and $B = \frac{1}{2}(\del_xf + i\del_yf)|_p$.

\defn

We define 
\begin{align*}
\del f_p & = f_z(p)dz_p \\
\bar{\del}f_p = f_{\bar{z}}(p)d\bar{z}_p \\
\end{align*}

The former is $\C$-linear, and the second $\C$-antilinear. 

\claim

$f$ is $\C$-differentiable at $p$ if and only if $f$ is $\R$-differentiable at $p$ and $\bar{\del}f_p = 0$

\proof

If $f = u + iv$, we get
\[
\bar{\del}f_p = \frac{\del f}{\del\bar{z}}(p) =0
\]
Which gives you the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 

So $f$ is analytic if $d_pf = f_zdz$. 

\exm

What are the following? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{\del|z|}{\del z}$
\item $\frac{\del|z|}{\del\bar{z}}$
\end{enumerate}

How do we manage these problems?

\claim If $m, k \in \Z\backslash\{0\}$, we will consider $d(z^m\bar{z}^k)$. We have $f(z + h) = (z + h)^m(\bar{z} + \bar{h})^m = f(z) + (mz^{m-1}\bar{z}^k)h + (k\bar{z}^{k - 1}z^m)\bar{h} + \mc{O}(h^2)$

Where $\frac{|LHS - RHS|}{|z - 2|} \to 0$ ad $z\to 2$

Then $\bar{\del}(z^m\bar{z}^k = (k\bar{z}^{k - 1}z^m)d\bar{z}$

Let's do some examples. Consider $\frac{\bar{z} - 1}{z + 1}$. We have

\[
\frac{\bar{z} - 1}{z + 1} = \frac{(\bar{z} - 2) - 2 - 1}{(z - 2) + 2 - 1} = \frac{(\bar{z} - z) + 1}{3}\frac{1}{1 + \frac{z - 2}{3}} = \frac{\bar{z} - 1}{3}(1 - \frac{z - 2}{3} + \mc{O}(H^2)) = cAz + B\bar{z} + \rho(z)
\]

There are two building blocks for doing problems: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, remember you are really doing real analysis. 
\item Use the formula $d_pf = \pi^{1, 0}\cdots $
\end{enumerate}

\exm

We will calculate $d|z| = d\sqrt{z\bar{z}}$.

\[
d|z| = d\sqrt{z\bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{z\bar{z}}}d(z\bar{z}) = \frac{1}{2|z|}d(z\bar{z}) = \frac{1}{2|z|}zd\bar{z} + \bar{z}dz
\]

So the answer would be $\frac{z}{2|z|}$. 

So, just express your function as a function of $z\bar{z}$ and proceed to do real analysis. 

We know $\del_zf, \del_{\bar{z}}f$, and want to find $\del_z(\bar{f}), \del_{\bar{z}}(\bar{f}) = ?$

We have

\begin{align*}
df = \del f & + \bar{\del}f \\
d(\bar{f})  &= \bar{df} = \bar{(\del f)} + \bar{(\bar{\del}f)} \\
\end{align*}

Now, $\bar{\del}(\bar{f}) = \bar{\del f}$. The bottom is equal to $\frac{\del \bar{f}}{\del\bar{z}}d\bar{z}$

So 

\[
\frac{\del \bar{f}}{\del \bar{z}} = \bar{\frac{\del f}{\del z}}
\]
The conjugate of something which is complex anti-linear is complex linear. 

What is $\frac{\del \bar{f}}{\del z}$? This is $\bar{\frac{\del f}{\del \bar{z}}}$. 

So, the general procedure is to decompose your function as something linear + something antilinear, and use the sentence I just wrote. 

How to compute $\frac{\del f\circ g}{\del \bar{z}}$ ?

Well $\underbrace{d(f\circ g) = df \circ df}_{\text{ The chain rule expresses the functoriality of the derivative}}$, which is equal to 

$(\del f + \bar{\del}f)\circ(\del g + \bar{\del}g) = \del f \circ \del g + \bar{\del f}\circ dg + \cdots$.

Now, $\bar{\del}f\circ\del g = f_{\bar{z}}d\bar{z}\circ(g_zdz) = f_{\bar{z}}\bar{g_z}$. 

\defn

Suppose $\frac{\del f}{\del \bar{z}}(p) = 0$. Then $df_p = \frac{\del f}{\del z}(p)dz_p$, and we write this as $f'(p)dz$. 

Homework problem: We know $f$ holomorphic, compute $\frac{\del}{\del}{\bar{z}}F(|f|)$, where $F:\R\to\R$ is smooth. 

So 

\[
dF(|f|) = F'(|f|)d|f| = F'(|f|)d\sqrt{f\bar{f}}
\]

And $d\sqrt{u} = \frac{1}{2u}du$, so the above is equal to 

\[
F'(|f|)\frac{1}{2|f|}d(f\bar{f})^{-1} = \frac{F'(|f|)}{2|f|}(\bar{f}df + fd\bar{z}) = \frac{F'(|f|}{2|f|}(\bar{f}f_zdz + f\bar{f_z}d\bar{z})
\]

Our answer is thus whatever we get in front of $d\bar{z}$, so in this case the solution is 

\[
\frac{\del}{\del\bar{z}}F(|f|) = \frac{F'(|f|)}{2|f|}f\bar{f'}
\]

The $|z| = \sqrt{z\bar{z}}$ is a very useful trick. 

Complex analysis is kind of a local study of $f:X\to\C$ for some $X\subseteq\C$, where $f$ is differentiable, $\bar{\del}f = 0$, or equivalently $\frac{\del f}{\del\bar{z}} = 0$ in $X$. Really, we are studying solutions to a certain PDE (Cauchy-Riemann equation). 

Suppose you want $u_{xx} - u_{yy} = 0$. If this is the case (and it turns out exactly when this is the case), we can express $u = \phi(x - y) + \psi(x + y)$ for $\phi, \psi$ arbitrary of $1$ variable. 

What if we want to study $u_y = u_{xx}$ in, say, $y > -\varepsilon$? We actually have a formula:

\[
u(x, y) = frac{1}{2\pi y}\int_{-\oo}^{\oo} e^{-\frac{(x - s)^2}{4y}}u(s, 0)ds, y > 0
\]

Suppose we want to study $u_{yy} + u_{xx} = 0$ in $y > -\varepsilon$, or maybe an open ball around the origin. We have a formula
\[
u(x, y) = \int_{-\oo}^\oo P_H(x, y - s)u(s, 0)ds
\]

Where $P_H$ is the Poisson Kernel. 

\subsection*{\underline{MAIN LOCAL THM}}
Let $f:B_{R + \varepsilon}\to \C$. Then the following statements are all equivalent. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item For any $p \in B_R$, $f$ is differentiable and $df_p = \del f_p$, so $\bar{\del}f_p = 0$.
\item $f(z) = \int_{C_R}\frac{f(w)}{z - w}dw$
\item Like 8 other things
\end{enumerate}

What exactly is complex integration? 

Let $\gamma:[a, b]\to\C$ be a piecewise smooth map. We integrate functions over maps. If $\phi$ is a continuous function, the formula is 

\[
\int_\gamma\phi(z)dz = \int_a^b\phi(\gamma(t))\dot{\gamma}(t)dt
\]

where $\dot{\gamma}$ is the time-derivative of $\gamma$, so will be a complex number. 

Let $t \in [0, 2\pi]$, $C_R(t) = Re^{it}$, a circle going counterclockwise. Let $\gamma(t) = Re^{-it}$. Then $\gamma^{-1}:[a, b]\to\C$ is the same but in the opposite direction. We have

\[
\int_{\gamma^{-1}}\phi\,dz = \int_{\gamma}\phi\,dz
\]
